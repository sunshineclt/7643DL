    "PyTorch comes with a nice paradigm for dealing with data which we'll use here. A PyTorch [`Dataset`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) knows where to find data in its raw form (files on disk) and how to load individual examples into Python datastructures. A PyTorch [`DataLoader`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) takes a dataset and offers a variety of ways to sample batches from that dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to browse through the `CIFAR10` `Dataset` in `2_pytorch/cifar10.py`, read the `DataLoader` documentation linked above, and see how these are used in the section of `train.py` that loads data. Note that in the first part of the homework we subtracted a mean CIFAR10 image from every image before feeding it in to our models. Here we subtract a constant color instead. Both methods are seen in practice and work equally well.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch provides lots of vision datasets which can be imported directly from [`torchvision.datasets`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/datasets.html). Also see [`torchtext`](https://github.com/pytorch/text#datasets) for natural language datasets."

    "\n",
    "In PyTorch Deep Learning building blocks are implemented in the neural network module [`torch.nn`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#) (usually imported as `nn`). A PyTorch model is typically a subclass of [`nn.Module`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) and thereby gains a multitude of features. Because your logistic regressor is an `nn.Module` all of its parameters and sub-modules are accessible through the `.parameters()` and `.modules()` methods.\n",

    "Now implement a softmax classifier by filling in the marked sections of `models/softmax.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main driver for this question is `train.py`. It reads arguments and model hyperparameter from the command line, loads CIFAR10 data and the specified model (in this case, softmax). Using the optimizer initialized with appropriate hyperparameters, it trains the model and reports performance on test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following couple of sections in `train.py`:\n",
    "1. Initialize an optimizer from the torch.optim package\n",
    "2. Update the parameters in model using the optimizer initialized above\n",
